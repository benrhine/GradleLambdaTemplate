# Serverless
Serverless Framework is intended to be a more generic way to deploy cloud applications by being somewhat abstract and
supporting most major cloud platforms.

### Expanded serverless configuration
For an expanded example of additional things that can be done in the `serverless.yml` take a look at the example file
under [Serverless Documentation](example/serverless.yml). While the sections are commented out, this file gives examples
of how to configure AWS REST Api with tired access policies as well as AWS HTTP Api (which is still REST) with OAuth
authentication.
